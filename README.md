As a part of a graduate-level advanced bioinformatics final project, I was given a task to analyzes given seqeunce(s) and yields outputs
in terms of DNA, RNA,Protein using Objected Orientated Programming(OOP) concepts.

The Python file is a 4-step process: #Step-1: Initialize values, #Step-2: Create Seq class, #Step-3: Create DNA class (must inherit Seq class), #Step-4: Create RNA class(Must inherit DNA class), #Step-5: Create Protenin class
